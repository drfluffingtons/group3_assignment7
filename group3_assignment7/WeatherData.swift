In order to display the current weather icon, which is returned as an http (rather than https) url, you'll need to add the potential addresses to a "white list" so iOS's App Transport will not reject the request due to its clear text transmission. also, something will need to be added to info.plist */

In order to access the API to do this, you will create a URL path that includes the address, the user key, which is required to access the website's API, and a request for JSON formatting. This URL path will look like this:
        https://api.worldweatheronline.com/premium/v1/weather.ashx?key=71f187bbe97b495988c165458182610&format=json
         
            by the way, my(Jessica's) api key is a159ff2780684394ad4233936201904 so we can use that one universally!*/
